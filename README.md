# Bikesharing

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to help pitch the idea of opening a Citibike like program in a different city. In this analysis we used CSVs, python, and Tableau to make the perfect presentation. Python was used to clean up and reformat some sections of data in the CSV file. We used Tableau to present the data in from that are much more paletable than a plain CSV. The final product is a beautifully crafted storyboard of multiple colorful charts that show bike utilization, popular areas, and untilization as breoken down by user type and gender.
