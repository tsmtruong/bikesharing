# Bikesharing

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to help pitch the idea of opening a Citibike like program in a different city. In this analysis we used CSVs, python, and Tableau to make the perfect presentation. Python was used to clean up and reformat some sections of data in the CSV file. We used Tableau to present the data in from that are much more paletable than a plain CSV. The final product is a beautifully crafted storyboard of multiple colorful charts that show bike utilization, popular areas, and untilization as breoken down by user type and gender.

## Results

![checkout_times](https://github.com/tsmtruong/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/checkout_times.jpg)

- This slide shows the average of time that the Cikibikes are used. As depicted in the graph most bikes are used for about 10 minutes.

![checkout_gender](https://github.com/tsmtruong/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/checkout_gender.jpg)

- This slide took the previous slide and broke down the data into gender categories. It shows that about 108K men rode for about 7-10 minutes, about 34K women averages about 7-10 minutes and about 5K wew unknown and averaged 10-30 minutes.

![trips_by_weekday](https://github.com/tsmtruong/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/trips_by_weekday.jpg)

This slide shows the hours during the days of the weeks the Citibikes are most commony used. The darker the color the more bikes were being used. As shown by the chart Thursday evenings between 5-6 PM is when the bikes were used the most.

![trips_by_gender](https://github.com/tsmtruong/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/trips_by_gender.jpg)

This slide takes the previous slide and further breaks down the data by gender. It shows that guring the most popular times majority of the Citibike riders were men. For Thursday at 5-6 PM there were about 30,00 men and about 10,000 female riders with about 2,000 unknown

![trips_by_usertype](https://github.com/tsmtruong/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/trips_by_usertype.jpg)

This slide shows the tpye of users that are riding the Citibikes during the month of August. The data shows that there are much more subscibers than regular customers that used the bikes during the month of August. However, there were more customers than subscibers in the "unknown" gender category

![top_starting](https://github.com/tsmtruong/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/top_starting_location.jpg)

This slide shows the top starting locations depicted by color and size. The darker and larger the circle the more bikes are rented out at these locations. After looking at latitude and longitude the top rented location is outside of Grand Central Station and mainly large tourist attractions. 

![top_ending](https://github.com/tsmtruong/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/top_ending.jpg)

This slide shows the top ending locations of Citibike trips, like the previous slide it is also broken down by color and size. Also similarly to the previous slide the ending locations also laregly correspond with popular tourist destinations, with Grand Central Station still being the most popular location.


## Summary

From our Tableau and Python visulization and analysis it seems that Citibikes are most popular to male subscribers, between the hours of 5 PM and 6 PM, around tourist attractions, during the month of August. If we were to start introducing the bikes to various other cities, I would suggest it be a smaller city with bikable tourist locations. To get furthur information I would suggest creating another visulization of the most common age of riders and also break down that visulization even further into gender to really get an idea on what is the age demographic of the Citibikes. I would also suggest running a visulization between popularity and maintenance frequency to see how much the bikes will need to be maintenanced and the workforce needed to hire to make sure it is done properly and promptly.
